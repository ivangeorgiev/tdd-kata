## Puzzles
### P1. Basic Arithmetic

```python
def magic(x, y):
    return x ** y + 1

print(magic(2, 3))
```

### Dictionary of dictionaries

```python
sales = {
    100: {'item': 'apple', 'price': .95 },
    101: {'item': 'banana', 'price': .55 },
    102: {'item': 'orange', 'price': .75 },
}

value = sales[102].get('price')
print(value)
```
1. What is the output?
2. What would be the difference if we use `sales[102]['price']` instead?
3. What is the role of the trailing comma at the "orange" line.

### List Operations X

```python
bool_val = all([
    1 == 1,
    7 // 2 == 2 + 1,
    2 == 6 % 4,
])

print(bool_val)
```

### String Comparison

```python
word = 'radar'
p = word == word[::-1]
print(p)
```

1. What is the output?
2. What would be the output if the word is changed to `Eifel`?


### Boolean Trickery IV

```python
s = sum([
    True,
    False,
    True,
    True,
])

print(s)
```

### List and Memory Address

```python
my_list = []
id_1 = id(my_list)

my_list = my_list + [1]
id_2 = id(my_list)

print(id_1 == id_2)
```

What if I change it slightly?

```python
my_list = []
id_1 = id(my_list)

my_list = my_list.extend([1])
id_2 = id(my_list)

print(id_1 == id_2)
```

And now?

```python
my_list = []
id_1 = id(my_list)

my_list.extend([1])
id_2 = id(my_list)

print(id_1 == id_2)
```


### Boolean Tricks

```python
data = [
    bool('0'),
    bool('?'),
    bool('-'),
    bool('e'),
    bool('False'),
    bool(0),
]
b = all(data)

print(b)
```

How would you change it so that it returns True if at least one element from the list evaluates to True?
